Receiving this scholarship will boost my self-confidence, knowing that I not only completed a very important task, but also took the responsibility of creating a foundation for getting me closer to my career goals. I believe in the importance of earning a college degree. Therefore, I plan to work extra hard to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree in Accounting.

The scholarship award will only push me further towards my Accounting degree and my dreams of one day having a successful career as an Accountant. Being the first generation in my family to attend college, I have always aspired to learn the right way to manage money and to produce successful budgets. I also believe in giving back to my community by helping others in financial crisis, so they won’t have the same financial burdens that I had growing up in a single familyHousehold.

Five years from now I see myself employed at a large local firm, crunching numbers, evaluating,and solving certain financial matters. I just feel blessed that I am given the opportunity to be awarded a scholarship to help fulfill my dream and I will prove that I do have what it takes to not only be a successful student, but an outstanding accountant.
