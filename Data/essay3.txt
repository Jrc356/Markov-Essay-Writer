I am in need of financial assistance in order to attend college because I am a low-income student. I am the 1st child to attend the college. Although my parents gave me many supports, I received a limited financial assistance due to low family income. To reduce family burden, I took out student loans to pay for my tuitions. Meanwhile, I am working 19 hours per week on campus to support myself. However, with the increasing tuitions this year, I am facing more challenges on financial need. As a senior in Petroleum Engineering, I wish to spend more time on my major courses because these courses are cores of my major and crucial in my future career. Unfortunately, financial burden may lessen my time on mastering the courses. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate a helping hand so that I can successfully obtain my engineering degree.
