While education can open many doors, success relies on initiative. I have the desire and the determination, but lack the financial backing needed to achieve my goal of becoming a Hospital Administrator. This scholarship would award me an opportunity to pursue the career of my dreams; a career rooted in service but threatened by a loss of altruism. My desire is to give a little bit extra and do a little bit more.

Receiving financial aid would allow me to make a difference in the ever changing, and challenging, world of health care. My family has always supported my efforts, but unfortunately they cannot afford my college fees. That is why I am taking the initiative of applying for a scholarship. My education will not be by chance, but by choice. These are my aspirations and I ask that you make them your choice.
